`./objinator PATH OPERATION NUMBER`

- `PATH` - path to the .obj file
- `OPERATION` - two letters: first describes the type of transformation (**m** = move, **s** = scale, **r** = rotate), second is the axis (**x**, **y**, or **z**, for move and scale can also be **a**, meaning all)
- `NUMBER` - the number to apply those transformations, amount, scale or angle
